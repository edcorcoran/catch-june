# Catch June

Can you catch June?

This is a a very simple game written for the [Playdate](https://play.date). It exists for me to teach myself Lua, the Playdate platform and game design concepts. I'm not gonna say this is a very fun game, but it is a video game technically speaking!

June is my dog. She is a very good dog.
